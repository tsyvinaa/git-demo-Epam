“You’d better not talk !” said Five. “ I  
heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved  
to be beheaded !”  
![THE QUEEN’S CROQUET-GROUND][30]

“What for ?” said the one who had spoken first.  
“That ’s none of your business, Two!” said Seven.  
“Yes, it is his business !” said Five, “ and I ’ll  
tell him—it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots  
instead of onions.” Seven flung down his brush,  
and had just begun, “Well, of  
all the unjust things—” when his eye chanced  
to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them,  
and he checked himself suddenly : the others  
looked round also, and all of them bowed low.
