## CHAPTER VIII

THE QUEEN’S CROQUET-GROUND

A LARGE rose-tree stood near the entrance of  
the garden: the roses growing on it were white,  
but there were three gardeners at it, busily  
painting them red. Alice thought this a very  
curious thing, and she went nearer to watch  
them, and just as she came up to them she  
heard one of them say, “Look out now, Five !  
Don’t go splashing paint over me like that !”  
“ I couldn’t help it,” said Five in a sulky  
tone; “Seven jogged my elbow.”  
On which Seven looked up and said, “That’s  
right, Five ! Always lay the blame on others !”

“You’d better not talk !” said Five. “ I  
heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved  
to be beheaded !”

“What for ?” said the one who had spoken first.  
“That ’s none of your business, Two!” said Seven.  
“Yes, it is his business !” said Five, “ and I ’ll  
tell him—it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots  
instead of onions.” Seven flung down his brush,  
and had just begun, “Well, of  
all the unjust things—” when his eye chanced  
to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them,  
and he checked himself suddenly : the others  
looked round also, and all of them bowed low.
